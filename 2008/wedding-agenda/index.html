We have roaming so can always be accessed via cellphone. Don’t hesitate to shoot an email – France enjoys one of the best connectivity in the World !\nJuly 5th Mona’s night – for whoever is around - no accomodation planned (i.e. need to book hotel if you want)\nJuly 11 There is nothing planned for Friday July 11 so free \u0026 easy for all\nJuly 12 There will be two parallel plans:\nFor family and brides/grooms people (you know who you are) Civil ceremony late morning, Lunch, Religious ceremony early afternoon\nEveryone else – Choice of free \u0026 easy day\n– Or taking an early afternoon (2:30PM) tour of Lille, courtesy of Jacques’ lovely sister and possibly Ye Jhen. The tour should finish around 4:30 to give you sufficient time to pamper yourself for the wedding\nThe Big Night – 7pm onward Transport is being planned; there will be some sort of transport to take everyone to the fiesta! The pick-up spot is in “La Place du Lion D’Or”, 1 minute walk from La Treille Hotel (where many of you are staying). The party should finish around 3AM – and we will do our best to get charitable souls to get you back to your hotel – worst case scenario we will have many taxi numbers. July 13 Jacques’ family will be hosting a “rebond” (lunch for those who come from far) at their house. For those who will still be around, please confirm so we can arrange appropriately or no wine for you (French can survive without food – not without wine :-)) July 14 Mona, Jacques, and Ahmad family are off to Paris to watch the 14th of July celebration on the Champs Elysees. July 15 Mona, Jacques, and Ahmad family are flying off to Malaysia. Travel details There is a direct train from Paris (Charles De Gaulle airport) to Lille. La Treille Hotel is Jacques’ family hotel recommendation. It is 10 to 15 minutes walk from the train station (there is a bus going there straight) For those who are arriving early and want to hang out in Paris on a tight budget, we recommend the Tiquetonne (affordable and conveniently located) Next steps For those who are still a “maybe” let us know ASAP Need to know who is able to come early and if so what day Need to know who is able to come to the July 13 lunch Should you have any question, doubt, inquiry, demand, interrogation, problem or proposition, PLEASE, do contact us !\n","wordCount":"471","inLanguage":"fr","datePublished":"2008-06-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2008-06-02T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jacques Duquesne"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://duquesn.com/2008/wedding-agenda/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Duquesn(e)","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://duquesn.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://duquesn.com/ accesskey=h title="Duquesn(e) (Alt + H)">Duquesn(e)</a>
